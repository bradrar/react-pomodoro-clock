This pomodoro clock will boost your creativity when you use it. 

The technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. These intervals are named pomodoros, the plural in English of the Italian word pomodoro (tomato), after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer that Cirillo used as a university student.

How to use pomodoro clock:

1. Set the Pomodoro to 25 minutes (the Pomodoro is the timer)
2. Work on the task until the Pomodoro rings.
3. Take a short break (5 minutes is OK)
4. Every 4 Pomodoros take a longer break.
